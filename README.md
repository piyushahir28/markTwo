<h1 align="center">CLI Quiz App created using NodeJS</h1>

This is a CLI app, basically a quiz named <strong>Money Heist.</strong> This app is for Money Heist's fans (including me :zany_face:), and for those who are eagerly waiting for the next release. Let's recap the previous episode. :heart_eyes: I created this while I am learning JavaScript for the first time.
