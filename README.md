<h1 align="center">NodeJS CLI App</h1>

This is a CLI app, basically a quiz named **Money Heist** created using NodeJS on [repl](https://replit.com/@piyushahir28/markTwo?embed=1&output=1). This app is for Money Heist's fans (including me :zany_face:), and for those who are eagerly waiting for the next release. Let's recap the previous episodes. :heart_eyes: I created this while I am learning JavaScript for the first time.
